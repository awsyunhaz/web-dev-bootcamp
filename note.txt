Tricky Stuff
1. `this` -> closest parent object
the global object (window)
2. Strict mode 
"use strict" 
-> `this` becomes undifined
3. To set the value of `this`:
call(thisArg, a, b, c, ...) - invoke immediately
apply(thisArg, [a, b, c, ...])
bind(thisArg, a, b, c, ...) - not invoke immediately
 -> return function definition
 -> useful when we do not know all values of argument
4. `new` set the context of `this`
